# Java Lab Project: Random Quote Generator

## Objective

Create a Java program that randomly selects and displays a quote when the user requests it. This lab will help you practice working with Java's Math library, random numbers, and string manipulation.

## Requirements

- Use Java's `Math.random()` method to generate random numbers.
- Use an array to store quotes.

---

## Instructions

### Step 1: Initialize Your Quotes

- **Hint**: Create a String array to hold your quotes.

---

### Step 2: Generate a Random Index

- **Hint**: Use `Math.random()` to generate a random index that corresponds to one of the positions in your quotes array.

---

### Step 3: Display a Random Quote

- **Hint**: Use the random index you generated to pick a quote from your array and display it using `System.out.println()`.

---

### Step 4: User Interaction

- **Hint 1**: Import the Scanner class for user interaction.
- **Hint 2**: Use a `do-while` loop to repeatedly ask the user if they want to see another quote or exit the program.

---

### Step 5: Close the Scanner

- **Hint**: Don't forget to close the Scanner to avoid resource leaks.

## Expected Output
```
Random Quote: The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.
Would you like to see another quote? (yes/no)
```
